# BiometricAuth

[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/tailoredmedia/maven/biometricauth/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/tailoredmedia/maven/biometricauth/_latestVersion)
![API 15](https://img.shields.io/badge/API-15-yellow.svg)

This library brings the new Android P BiometricPrompt for fingerprint authentication to Android SDK 23, using RxJava (2 or 3) and Kotlin.


| Android 23..27 (>= Marshmallow)  |  Android >= 28 (Pie, Q) |
| :------------------------------: | :---------------------: |
| ![Dialog on Marshmallow devices](https://github.com/tailoredmedia/BiometricAuth/raw/master/screenshots/marshmallow.gif "Dialog shown on Android 23..27 devices") | ![Dialog on Pie devices](https://github.com/tailoredmedia/BiometricAuth/raw/master/screenshots/pie.gif "Dialog shown on Android >= 28 devices") |


## Setup

To use this library your `minSdkVersion` must be >= 15 (Note that the dialog however will only show starting Android SDK 23).

In your root-level build.gradle file, make sure you include the following maven repository:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url 'https://maven.tailored-apps.com/repository/maven-biometricauth/'
            // The content-filter ensures (for your safety) that only artifacts with the given group 
            // should be fetched from this repository:
            content { includeGroup 'com.tailoredapps' }
        }
    }
}
```

In your application build.gradle file, include the dependency (for RxJava2):
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.tailoredapps:biometricauth-rxjava2:1.3.1'
}
```

Or if you are using RxJava3:
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.tailoredapps:biometricauth-rxjava3:1.3.1'
}
```


## Usage


Create a `BiometricAuth` instance:

```kotlin
val biometricAuth = BiometricAuth.create(this, useAndroidXBiometricPrompt = false) // where this is an (AppCompat-)Activity
```

```kotlin
if(!biometricAuth.hasFingerprintHardware) {
    //The devices does not support fingerprint authentication (i.e. has no fingerprint hardware)
    Toast.makeText(this, "Device does not support fingerprint", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
} else if(!biometricAuth.hasFingerprintsEnrolled) {
    //The user has not enrolled any fingerprints (i.e. fingerprint authentication is not activated by the user)
    Toast.makeText(this, "User has not enrolled any fingerprints", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
} else {
    biometricAuth
        .authenticate(
                title = "Please authenticate",
                subtitle = "'Awesome Feature' requires your authentication",
                description = "'Awesome Feature' exposes data private to you, which is why you need to authenticate.",
                negativeButtonText = "Cancel",
                prompt = "Touch the fingerprint sensor",
                notRecognizedErrorText = "Not recognized"
        )
        .subscribe(
                { Log.d("BiometricAuth", "User authentication successful.") },
                { throwable ->
                    if(throwable is BiometricAuthenticationCancelledException) {
                        Log.d("BiometricAuth", "User cancelled the operation")
                    } else if(throwable is BiometricAuthenticationException) {
                        // Might want to check throwable.errorMessageId for fields in BiometricConstants.Error,
                        // to get more information about the error / further actions here.
                        Log.d("BiometricAuth", "Unrecoverable authentication error")
                    } else {
                        Log.d("BiometricAuth", "Error during user authentication.")
                    }
                }
        )
}
```

The `authenticate()` function returns a [Completable](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/io/reactivex/Completable.html), which either:

* completes, which indicates an authentication success, or
* emits an error:
  * [`BiometricAuthenticationCancelledException`](https://github.com/tailoredmedia/BiometricAuth/blob/master/biometricauth/src/main/java/com/tailoredapps/biometricauth/Exceptions.kt), which signals that the operation has been cancelled (most likely triggered by the user).
  * [`BiometricAuthenticationException`](https://github.com/tailoredmedia/BiometricAuth/blob/master/biometricauth/src/main/java/com/tailoredapps/biometricauth/Exceptions.kt), which signals an unrecoverable error during biometric authentication (e.g. too many invalid attempts).
    The exception contains the localized error-message provided by the system.
    Furthermore, the errorMessageId contained in this exception is most likely one of the fields in [`BiometricConstants.Error`](https://github.com/tailoredmedia/BiometricAuth/blob/master/biometricauth/src/main/java/com/tailoredapps/biometricauth/BiometricConstants.kt) (but not exclusively), which allows to get more information on the type or error.
  * any other _unexpected_ error during authentication (Not any of the *internal* fingerprint errors like "not detected", as they will be handled internally).


### CryptoObject

If you need to pass a crypto-object, add a `BiometricAuth.CryptoObject` as a first parameter to the `BiometricAuth.authenticate` method, which will then return a [Single](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/io/reactivex/Single.html) including the CryptoObject as a success-value.


## What's inside?

On Android P/Q (SDK >= 28) devices, the new [BiometricPrompt](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt) API is used.

On devices running Android Marshmallow to Oreo (SDK 23..27), the [FingerprintManagerCompat](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/hardware/fingerprint/FingerprintManagerCompat) API is used in combination with a custom UI, which imitates the AndroidPie BiometricPrompt Bottom-Sheet.

On older devices, where Fingerprint Authentication is not supported by native Android SDKs, calling `hasFingerprintHardware` or `hasFingerprintsEnrolled` will always return false.
